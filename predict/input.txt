Transformed the bacteria with PPK1 gene plasmid (PPK1 converts reversible poly p into Pi and generates ATP). Detected increased electron transfer activity and decreased phosphorus removal efficiency in transformed bacteria.
Transformed the bacteria with PPX gene plasmid (PPX converts poly p into Pi without generating ATP). Detected increased electron transfer activity and improved phosphorus removal efficiency in transformed bacteria.
Transformed the bacteria with PPK2 gene plasmid (PPK2 reversibly converts pi into poly p and utilizes ATP). Detected increased electron transfer activity and improved phosphorus removal efficiency in transformed bacteria.
Transformed the bacteria with PAP gene plasmid (PAP utilizes poly p and AMP to synthesize ATP). Detected decreased electron transfer activity and improved phosphorus removal efficiency in transformed bacteria.
Transformed the bacteria with NADK gene plasmid (NADK utilizes NAD and poly p to generate NADP). Detected decreased electron transfer activity and decreased phosphorus removal efficiency in transformed bacteria.
