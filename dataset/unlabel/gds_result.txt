(Submitter supplied) Long-range gene regulation is rare in bacteria and is confined to the classical DNA looping model. Here, we use a combination of biophysical approaches, including X-ray crystallography and single-molecule analysis, to show that long-range gene silencing on the plasmid RK2, a source of multidrug resistance across diverse Gram-negative bacteria, is achieved cooperatively by a DNA-sliding clamp, KorB, and a clamp-locking protein, KorA. more...

3. Genome concentration limits cell growth and modulates proteome composition in Escherichia coli
(Submitter supplied) Defining the cellular factors that drive growth rate and proteome composition is essential for understanding and manipulating cellular systems. In bacteria, ribosome concentration is known to be a constraining factor of cell growth rate, while gene concentration is usually assumed not to be limiting. Here, using single-molecule tracking, quantitative single-cell microscopy, and modeling, we show that genome dilution in Escherichia coli cells arrested for DNA replication results in a decrease in the concentration of active RNA polymerases and ribosomes. more...

4. Differential effects of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH/GuaB) inhibition in Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli
(Submitter supplied) Inosine 5’-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the de novo guanine biosynthesis and is conserved from humans to bacteria, where it is called GuaB. We developed a series of potent inhibitors that selectively target GuaB over its human homolog. Here we show that these GuaB inhibitors are bactericidal, generate phenotypic signatures that are distinct from other antibiotics, and elicit different time-kill kinetics and regulatory responses in two important gram-negative pathogens: Acinetobacter baumannii and Escherichia coli. more...

SPO11 is critical for meiosis in most species but the DSBs it makes are also dangerous because of their mutagenic and gametocidal potential, so cells must foster beneficial functions of SPO11 while minimizing its risks. SPO11 mechanism and regulation remain poorly understood. Here we report reconstitution of DNA cleavage in vitro with purified recombinant mouse SPO11 bound to its essential partner TOP6BL. more...

20. Nuclear PKM2 binds pre-mRNA at folded G-quadruplexes and reveals their gene regulatory role
(Submitter supplied) Nuclear translocation of the key metabolic enzyme Pyruvate Kinase Isoform 2 (PKM2) is widely observed in cancer, but its contribution to gene regulation and pathogenesis remains unclear. Here we find that PKM2 specifically recognized folded RNA G-quadruplex (rG4) structures in vitro with high affinity. In human cells, nuclear PKM2 bound thousands of precursor mRNAs at potential rG4 sites and translocation of PKM2 to the nucleus resulted in increased expression of rG4-containing mRNAs.

Despite extensive efforts, the exact mechanisms governing how Cre distinguishes between substrates remains elusive. Cre recognizes 13 bp inverted repeats, initiating recombination in the 8 bp spacer region. While literature suggests that efficient recombination proceeds between lox sites with non-loxP spacer sequences when both lox sites have matching spacers, experimental validation for this assumption is lacking. more...

However, the current method has substantial issues: contamination by rRNAs and the lack of appropriate methods to measure ribosome numbers in transcripts. Here, we overcomeovercame these hurdles through the development of “Ribo-FilterOut”, which is based on the separation of footprints from ribosome subunits by ultrafiltration, and “Ribo-Calibration”, which relies on external spike-ins of stoichiometrically defined mRNA-ribosome complexes. more...

28. Activation of the PARIS immune complex by viral proteins results in host tRNA cleavage and can be overcome by viruses encoding non-cleavable tRNAs
(Submitter supplied) Viruses compete with other viruses for limited cellular recourses, and some viruses deliver defense mechanisms that protect the host from competing genetic parasites. PARIS is a defense system, often encoded in viral genomes, that is composed of a 53 kDa ABC ATPase (AriA) and a 35 kDa TOPRIM nuclease (AriB). Here we show that AriA and AriB assemble into a 425 kDa supramolecular immune complex. We use cryo-EM to determine the structure of this complex which explains how six molecules of AriA assemble into a propeller-shaped scaffold that coordinates three subunits of AriB. more...

(Submitter supplied) Bacteria respond to changes in their external environment like temperature by changing the transcription of their genes, but we know little about how these regulatory patterns evolve. We used RNA-seq to study the transcriptional response of a shift from 37°C to 15°C in wild-type Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica, Citrobacter rodentium, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens, as well as ∆rpoS strains of E. more...

38. mDRIP-seq is a high-throughput method for quantitative R-loop landscape profiling
(Submitter supplied) Current methods for R-loop profiling need to perform experiments for each sample individually, with consequent limitations in throughput. Here, based on the barcoding strategy, we develop mDRIP-seq, a high-throughput method showing equivalent performance as conventional methods, but with merits of 7-fold less cost and 6-fold less hand-on time per sample. We also show the simplicity and effectiveness of mDRIP-seq for relative and absolute quantitation of genomic R-loop fractions for multiple samples. more...

42. R-loop landscapes during parental-to-zygotic transition in zebrafish
(Submitter supplied) The R-loop is a common chromatin feature presented from prokaryotic to eukaryotic genomes and has been revealed to be involved in multiple cellular processes. Here, we developed a novel R-loop profiling technique, ULI-ssDRIP-seq, to decte global R-loops from a limited number of cells. Based on this method, we profiled the R-loop landscapes during parental-to-zygotic transition and early development regulatory in zebrafish, and revealed a series of important characters of R-loops.

46. RNAP stalling-derived genome instability underlies ribosomal antibiotics efficacy and resistance evolution (ChIP-seq data)
(Submitter supplied) Bacteria often evolve antibiotic resistance through mutagenesis. However, the processes causing the mutagenesis have not been fully resolved. Here we found that a broad range of ribosome-targeting antibiotics caused mutations through an underexplored pathway. Focusing on the clinically important aminoglycoside gentamicin, we found that the translation inhibitor caused genome-wide premature stalling of RNA polymerase (RNAP) in a loci-dependent manner. more...

48. Spermine-induced DNA methylation change in human macrophages
(Submitter supplied) Polyamines, crucial molecules involved in cell proliferation and growth, play a pivotal role in cancer development and progression. Within the tumor microenvironment, macrophages, key components of the immune system, exhibit a complex relationship with polyamines. Evidence suggests that polyamines can modulate macrophage polarization, influencing their functional phenotypes. Here, we detected the gene DNA methylation changes in spermine-stimulated human macrophages isolated from PBMCs and TAMs.

49. Bacteria conjugate ubiquitin-like proteins to interfere with phage assembly
(Submitter supplied) Multiple immune pathways in humans conjugate ubiquitin-like proteins to virus and host molecules as a means of antiviral defense. Here we studied an anti-phage defense system in bacteria, comprising a ubiquitin-like protein, ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes E1 and E2, and a deubiquitinase. We show that during phage infection, this system specifically conjugates the ubiquitin-like protein to the phage central tail fiber, a protein at the tip of the tail that is essential for tail assembly as well as for recognition of the target host receptor. more...

These widespread gene families were repeatedly domesticated over evolutionary timescales, leading to the emergence of diverse CRISPR-associated nucleases including Cas9 and Cas12. We set out to test the hypothesis that TnpB nucleases may have also been repurposed for novel, unexpected functions other than CRISPR-Cas. more...

61. A new reagent for in vivo structure probing of RNA G and U residues that improves RNA structure prediction alone and combined with DMS
(Submitter supplied) A key to understanding the roles of RNA in regulating gene expression is knowing their structures in vivo. One way to obtain this information is through probing structures of RNA with chemicals. To probe RNA structure directly in cells, membrane-permeable reagents that modify the Watson-Crick (WC) face of unpaired nucleotides can be used. While dimethyl sulfate (DMS) has led to substantial insight into RNA structure, it has limited nucleotide specificity in vivo, with WC face reactivity only at Adenine (A) and Cytosine (C) at neutral pH. more...

72. ENVIRONMENT MODULATES PROTEIN HETEROGENEITY THROUGH TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND TRANSLATIONAL STOP CODON RECODING
(Submitter supplied) In order to systematically assess the frequency and origin of stop codon recoding events, we designed a library of reporters. We introduced premature stop codons into mScarlet that enabled high-throughput quantification of protein synthesis termination errors in E. coli using fluorescent microscopy. We found that under stress conditions, stop codon recoding may occur with a rate as high as 80%, depending on the nucleotide context, suggesting that evolution frequently samples stop codon recoding events. more...

110. A phage-encoded RNA-binding protein inhibits the antiviral activity of a toxin-antitoxin system
(Submitter supplied) Bacteria harbor diverse mechanisms to defend themselves against their viral predators, bacteriophages. In response, phages can evolve counter-defense systems, most of which remain poorly understood. In T4-like phages, the gene tifA prevents bacterial defense by the type III toxin-antitoxin (TA) system toxIN, but the mechanism by which TifA inhibits toxIN remains unclear. Here, we show that TifA directly binds both the endoribonuclease ToxN and RNA, leading to the formation of a high molecular weight ribonucleoprotein complex in which ToxN is inhibited. more...

111. Structural stability based deep sequencing of 5 protein targets
(Submitter supplied) We developed an efficient, cost-effective assay for Structural Inference By Structure-stability-based selection of deep mutation variants and high throughput sequencing (Sibs-Seq). We demonstrated that unlike naturally occurring homologous sequences evolved over billions of years, these stability-selected, artificial homologs in a single-round 24 or 36 hours of mutation selections is often sufficient for producing high-accuracy structure prediction with < 2 angstrom root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) to the native structure.

112. Transcriptional units form the elementary constraining building blocks of the bacterial chromosome
(Submitter supplied) Transcription generates local topological and mechanical constraints along the DNA fiber, driving for instance the generation of supercoiled chromosomal domains in bacteria. However, the global impact of transcription-based regulation of chromosome organization remains elusive. Notably, the scale of genes and operons in bacteria remains well below the resolution of chromosomal contact maps generated using Hi-C (~ 5 - 10 kb), preventing to resolve the impact of transcription on genomic organization at the fine-scale. more...

(Submitter supplied) RNA-guided endonucleases form the crux of diverse biological processes and technologies, including adaptive immunity, transposition, and genome editing. Some of these enzymes are components of insertion sequences (IS) in the IS200/IS605 and IS607 transposon families. Both IS families encode a TnpA transposase and TnpB nuclease, an RNA-guided enzyme ancestral to CRISPR-Cas12. In eukaryotes and their viruses, TnpB homologs occur as two distinct types, Fanzor1 and Fanzor2. more...

116. A novel acetyltransferase regulates the RNA binding capacity of the RNA chaperone Hfq in Escherichia coli
(Submitter supplied) Bacterial small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) regulate gene expression by base-pairing to their target mRNAs. In Escherichia coli and many other bacteria, this process is dependent on the RNA chaperone Hfq, which binds sRNAs and mRNAs on different faces. YhbS (renamed here as HqbA), a putative Gcn5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT), was identified as a novel silencer of sRNA signaling in a genomic library screen. more...

(Submitter supplied) Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 is a notorious foodborne pathogen capable of causing severe gastrointestinal infections in humans. The bovine rectoanal junction (RAJ) has been identified as a primary reservoir of STEC O157:H7, playing a critical role in its transmission to humans through contaminated food sources. Despite the relevance of this host-pathogen interaction, the molecular mechanisms behind the adaptation of STEC O157:H7 in the bovine RAJ and its subsequent infection of human colonic epithelial cells remain largely unexplored. more...

119. Nascent elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) show different pause registers with apyrase treatment during library preparation
(Submitter supplied) Transcriptional pausing aids gene regulation by cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs). In many bacteria, a surface-exposed domain inserted into the catalytic trigger loop (TL) of RNAP, called SI3 in Escherichia coli, modulates pausing and is essential for growth. Here we describe a viable E. coli strain lacking SI3 enabled by a suppressor TL substitution (β'Ala941→Thr; ∆SI3*). ∆SI3* increased transcription rate in vitro relative to ∆SI3, possibly explaining its viability, but retained both positive and negative effects of ∆SI3 on pausing. more...

120. Nascent elongating transcript sequencing (NET-seq) with SI3 domain-deleted Escherichia coli reveals different pause profiles from wildtype
(Submitter supplied) Transcriptional pausing is a fundamental mechanism that aids gene regulation by cellular RNA polymerases (RNAPs). In many bacterial lineages, a large, surface-exposed domain inserted into the catalytic trigger loop (TL) of RNAP called sequence insertion 3 (SI3) modulates transcription pausing. However, the in vivo roles of SI3 remain largely unknown due in part to the lethality of SI3 deletion. Here we describe construction of a viable Escherichia coli strain with a complete SI3 deletion enabled by a suppressor missense mutation in the portion of rpoC encoding the TL (ß′A941T; ∆SI3*). more...

122. Discovery of diverse DNA cytosine deaminases enables a single-enzyme method for base resolution methylation detection
(Submitter supplied) Cytosine deaminases have important uses in the detection of epigenetic modifications and in genome editing. However, the range of applications of deaminases is limited by their substrate preference. To expand the toolkit of deaminases, we developed an in-vitro approach that bypasses a major hurdle with their severe toxicity in expression hosts. We screened 175 putative cytosine deaminases, primarily from bacteria, and found enzymes with strong activity on double- and single-stranded DNA in various sequence contexts, including some without any sequence constraints. more...

123. Porin-mediated passage of negamycin across the outer membrane of Escherichia coli
(Submitter supplied) The rise of antimicrobial resistant pathogens calls for new antibacterial treatments, but potent new compounds are scarce. Development of new antibiotics is difficult, especially against Gram-negative bacteria, as here uptake is strongly hindered by the additional outer membrane. Most antimicrobial agents against Gram-negatives use the porin mediated pathway to cross the outer membrane, which limits the choice of an antibiotic, as it has to fit by size, charge and hydrophilicity. more...

124. Bacterial mRNA sequencing through targeted rRNA depletion for efficient RNA-seq in varied species and co-cultures
(Submitter supplied) mRNA sequencing in bacteria is challenging due to the abundance of ribosomal rRNA that cannot be easily removed prior to sequencing. While commercially available kits target specific rRNA sequences found in defined lists of common bacterial species, they are frequently inefficient when applied to other divergent species, including those from environmental isolates. Similar to the commercial kits, other common techniques for rRNA depletion typically employ large probe sets that tile full-length rRNA sequences; however, such approaches are both time consuming and expensive when applied to multiple species or complex consortia of non-model microbes. more...

Escherichia coli has a well characterized regulatory network to induce multiple defense mechanisms against excess of protons. Nevertheless, systemic studies of the transcriptional and translational reprogramming of E. coli to different acidic strengths have not yet been performed. Here, we used ribosome profiling and mRNA sequencing to determine the response of E. more...

(Submitter supplied) Compartmentalization of RNA in biopolymer-rich membraneless organelles is now understood to be pervasive and critical for the function of extant biology, and has been proposed as a prebiotically-plausible way to accumulate RNA. Compartment-RNA interactions that drive encapsulation have the potential to influence RNA structure and function in compartment- and RNA sequence-dependent ways. Herein, we detail Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) experiments performed for the first time in membraneless compartments called complex coacervates to characterize the fold of many different transfer RNAs (tRNAs) simultaneously under the potentially denaturing conditions of these compartments. more...

(Submitter supplied) Synthesis of flagella is very energy intensive and, while extensive transcriptional regulation has been described, little is known about the post-transcriptional regulation. Small RNAs (sRNAs) are widespread posttranscriptional regulators; most base pairing with mRNAs to affect their stability and/or translation. Here we describe four UTR-derived sRNAs (UhpU, MotR, FliX and FlgO) whose expression is controlled by the flagella sigma factor, sigma 28 in Escherichia coli. more...

128. The environmentally-regulated interplay between three-dimensional chromatin organisation and transcription of the Escherichia coli proVWX operon
(Submitter supplied) Nucleoid associated proteins maintain the architecture of bacterial chromosomes and regulate gene expression. Thus, their role as transcription factors may involve three-dimensional chromosome re-modelling. Here, we provide the first in vivo evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using RT-qPCR and 3C-qPCR, we show that activation of the H-NS-regulated, osmosensitive proVWX operon of Escherichia coli in response to a hyperosmotic shock involves the destabilization of H-NS-mediated bridges anchored between the proVWX downstream and upstream regulatory elements (DRE and URE), and between the DRE and ygaY that lies immediately downstream of proVWX. more...

In bacteria, the biosynthesis of Q involves two precursors, preQ0 and preQ1, whereas eukaryotes directly obtain Q from bacterial sources. The study of queuosine has been challenging due to the limited availability of high-throughput methods for its detection and analysis. more...

134. Multimodal multiscale analysis reveals flexible DNA contacts of bacterial nucleoprotein filaments
(Submitter supplied) Gene silencing in bacteria is mediated by chromatin proteins, of which Escherichia coli H-NS is a paradigmatic example. H-NS forms nucleoprotein filaments with either one or two DNA duplexes. However, the overall structures, arrangements of DNA-binding domains (DBDs), positions of DBD–DNA contacts, and determinants of genomic distribution for these linear and bridged filaments are uncertain. To connect H-NS structures that silence genes in vivo with features elucidated in vitro, we developed a multimodal multiscale analysis that combines a new method for chromatin reconstitution and mapping (Nitro-seq), ChIP-seq, tethered-nuclease mapping of DBD–DNA contacts (TEN-map), ·OH footprinting, molecular dynamics, and bioinformatics. more...

141. 5’-NAD-RNA identification in E. coli BW25113 wt, nudC and csdA knockouts
(Submitter supplied) In the present study we applied NAD captureSeq to charecterize the 5'-NAD-RNA profile of E. coli BW25113 wt strain as well as nudC and csdA knockouts. The data obtained showed that both knockouts resulted in an increased number of identified 5’-NAD-RNA species, thus suggesting that CsdA might add a potentially new layer of control on NAD-epitranscriptomic landscape.

(Submitter supplied) Abstract: tRNAs are highly modified in the elbow region and harbor 5-methyluridine at position 54 and pseudouridine at position 55 in the T arm, which are generated by the enzymes TrmA and TruB, respectively. Although all elongator tRNAs contain these modifications across all domains of life, the cellular relevance of these modifications and their corresponding modifying enzymes remains elusive. In addition to modifying every tRNA, Escherichia coli TrmA and TruB have both been shown to fold tRNA independently of its modification activity acting as tRNA chaperones, and strains lacking trmA or truB are outcompeted by wildtype. more...

225. Aminoglycosides induce a bacterial senescent state that increases antibiotic tolerance in treatment-naïve cells 
(Submitter supplied) Antibiotics are a triumph of modern medicine, but their power to cure infections is being eroded through the evolution and dissemination of resistance.  Evolution of genetic resistance is in part facilitated by non-genetic resistance mechanisms that increase antibiotic tolerance buying time for evolutionary innovation.  Using live cell imaging, we discovered that Escherichia coli treated with aminoglycosides permanently lose the ability to divide within 4 hours, yet a majority of cells maintain membrane integrity and metabolic 2 days post treatment, and some continuing activity for up to > 4 days post treatment – a bacterial senescent-like state.  These cells, which we term zombies, exhibit dynamic gene expression and metabolomic profiles even after exiting the cell cycle.  Gene expression data revealed upregulated the phage shock protein response maintained membrane integrity.  Remarkably, these zombie cells, though unable to form new colonies, increase antibiotic tolerance of treatment-naïve cells, implying chemical communication.  Chemical supplementation and genetic knockouts showed that zombies communicate to treatment-naïve cells by secreting indole.  In summary, our study revealed a bacterial senescent-like state, induced by aminoglycosides, that modifies the antibiotic tolerance of multiple bacterial species.

228. Vertical and horizontal gene transfer tradeoffs direct plasmid fitness
(Submitter supplied) Plasmid fitness is directed by two orthogonal processes—vertical transfer through cell division and horizontal transfer through conjugation. When considered individually, improvements in either mode of transfer can promote how well a plasmid spreads and persists. Together, however, the metabolic cost of conjugation could create a tradeoff that constrains plasmid evolution. Here we present evidence for the presence, consequences, and molecular basis of a conjugation-growth tradeoff across 40 plasmids derived from clinical E. more...

251. Prevalence of multi-resistant plasmids in hospital inhalable particulate matter  (PM) and its impact on horizontal gene transfer
(Submitter supplied) Antibiotic resistance is exacerbated by the exchange of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) between microbes from diverse habitats. Plasmids are important ARGs mobile elements and are spread by horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In this study, we demonstrated the presence of multi-resistant plasmids from inhalable particulate matter (PM) and its effect on gene horizontal transfer. Three transferable multi-resistant plasmids were identified from PM in a hospital, using conjugative mating assays and nanopore sequencing. more...

295. Transcriptomic analysis of homoserine-evolved MG1655 strain (wild type) and of homoserine -treated wild type, mutant deleted for thrL and mutant bearing thrL* allele
(Submitter supplied) The growth of E. coli is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of L-homoserine, which may be problematic for the industrial production of this compound or for products derived from it. In this work, an adapted laboratory evolution (ALE) was applied, which resulted in the isolation of an E. coli strain at least 10-fold more tolerant to L-homoserine than the original (MG1655) strain. Only four genomic modifications were identified after genome sequencing of this evolved strain (designed 4E), including a 49 bp truncation starting from the codon stop of thrL and leading to a modified thrL locus carrying a thrL* allele encoding a 30 amino acids polypeptide, which is 9 amino acids more than the leader peptide encoded by thrL. more...

Following a long-standing approach, reads shorter than 16 nucleotides (nt) are removed from the small RNA sequencing libraries or datasets. The serendipitous discovery of a 12 nt-long RNA species capable of modulating the microRNA from which they derive prompted us to challenge this dogma, and by expanding the window of RNA sizes down to 8 nt, to confirm the existence of functional very small RNAs (vsRNAs <16nt). more...

329. Sequence-dependent model of genes with dual σ factor preference
(Submitter supplied) Escherichia coli uses σ factors to quickly control large gene cohorts during stress conditions. While most of its genes respond to a single σ factor, approximately 5% of them have dual σ factor preference. The most common are those responsive to both σ70, which controls housekeeping genes, and σ38, which activates genes during stationary growth and stresses. Using RNA-seq and flow-cytometry measurements, we show that ‘σ70+38 genes’ are nearly as upregulated in stationary growth as ‘σ38 genes’. more...

(Submitter supplied) Kasugamycin (KSG) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used in agriculture and exhibiting considerable medical potential. Previous studies suggested that KSG interferes with translation by blocking binding of canonical mRNA and initiator tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit thereby preventing initiation of protein synthesis. Here, by using genome-wide approaches, we show that KSG can interfere with translation even after the formation of the 70S initiation complex on mRNA, as the extent of KSG-mediated translation inhibition correlates with increased occupancy of start codons by 70S ribosomes. more...

384. Transcription-wide distribution of dihydrouridine (D) into mRNAs reveals its requirement for meiotic chromosome segregation. [Rho-Seq]
(Submitter supplied) Here we have developed Rho-seq, an integrated pipeline detecting a range of modifications through differential modification-dependent Rhodamine labeling. Using Rho-seq, we report that the reduction of uridine to dihydrouridine by the Dus reductase family targets tRNAs in E. coli but expands to mRNAs is yeast. The modified mRNAs are enriched for cytoskeleton related encoded protein. We show that the a-tubulin encoding mRNA nda2 undergoes dihydrouridination, which affects its protein expression level. more...

However tools to profile the genome landscape and binding of key architectural proteins have been limited. We recently discovered densely occupied, multi-kilobase regions in E. coli that are transcriptionally silent, similar to eukaryotic heterochromatin. These regions, termed EPODs, overlap metabolic pathways and parasitic elements such as prophages. more...

(Submitter supplied) We investigated the effect of a temperature shift from 23˚C to 37˚C, mimicking the temperature transition experienced by a microbe as it enters a human host.  This strategy allowed the exploration of the kinetics of gene expression changes in immediate response to a temperature upshift and to characterize the suite of genes required to respond to 37˚C in the first few hours.  We demonstrate that a significant number of genes are rapidly altered in expression within minutes to hours after a temperature shift. more...

Hfq has a conserved N-terminal domain and a poorly conserved disordered C-terminal domain (CTD). In a transcriptome-wide examination of the effects of a chromosomal CTD deletion (Hfq1-65), the Escherichia coli mutant was most defective for the accumulation of sRNAs that bind the proximal and distal faces of Hfq (Class II sRNAs), but other sRNAs also were affected. more...

(Submitter supplied) Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is the only ribonuclease responsible for 5'-end maturation of tRNAs in all kingdoms of life.  In Escherichia coli, it is also essential for separation of pre-tRNAs from multiple polycistronic transcripts.  Using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we show here that RNase P affects the abundance of ~44% of the expressed mRNAs demonstrating a much more widespread role in mRNA decay than previously thought. more...

Among many changes spermidine altered the iron-sulfur cluster metabolism and redox balance in the cells. Therefore, we have shown that superoxide quencher, NAC and ascorbate mitigates spermidine stress. Overall our data explains the importaance of tight spermidine homeostasisin the cell.

(Submitter supplied) N1-methylation of G37 is required for a subset of tRNAs to maintain the translational reading-frame. While loss of m1G37 increases ribosomal +1 frameshifting, whether it incurs additional translational defects is unknown. Here we address this question by applying ribosome profiling to gain a genome-wide view of the effects of m1G37 deficiency on protein synthesis. Using E. coli as a model, we show that m1G37 deficiency induces ribosome stalling at codons that are normally translated by m1G37-containing tRNAs. more...

431. Identification of a transcription factor, PunR, that regulates the purine and purine nucleoside transporter punC in E. coli
(Submitter supplied) Many genes in bacterial genomes are of unknown function, often referred to as y-genes. Recently, the analytic methods have divided bacterial transcriptomes into independently modulated sets of genes (iModulons). Functionally annotated iModulons that contain y-genes lead to testable hypotheses to elucidate y-gene function. The inversely correlated expression of a putative transporter gene, ydhC, relative to purine biosynthetic genes, has led to the hypothesis that it encodes a purine-related transporter and revealed a LysR-family regulator, YdhB, with a predicted 23-bp palindromic binding motif. more...

434. Testing the impact of Type I Restriction Modification Systems on Gene Expression in Uropathogenic Escherichia coli
(Submitter supplied) Background: DNA methylation influences transcriptional regulation, and therefore cellular phenotype, across all domains of life. The regulatory role of DNA methylation and other epigenetic marks also extends to virulence; both orphan methyltransferases and those from restriction modification systems (RMSs) have been co-opted to regulate virulence in many bacteria. However, functional characterisation of DNA methylation mediated by archetypal Type I RMSs remains limited. more...

(Submitter supplied) Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a very common bacterial infectious disease  in humans, and uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) are the most frequent cause of UTIs. During infection, UPEC must cope with a variety of stressful conditions in the urinary tract. Here, we demonstrated that the small RNA (sRNA) RyfA of UPEC strains was required for resistance to oxidative and osmotic stresses.  Inactivation of ryfA in UPEC strain CFT073 decreased urinary tract colonization in CBA/J mice and the ryfA mutant also had reduced production of type 1 and P fimbriae, which are known to be important for UTI. more...

480. Massively parallel characterization of CYP2C9 variant enzyme activity and abundance
(Submitter supplied) CYP2C9 encodes a cytochrome P450 enzyme responsible for metabolizing up to 15% of small molecule drugs, and CYP2C9 variants can alter the safety and efficacy of these therapeutics. In particular, the anti-coagulant warfarin is prescribed to over 15 million people annually and polymorphisms in CYP2C9 can affect patient response leading to an increased risk of hemorrhage. We developed Click-seq, a pooled yeast-based activity assay to test thousands of variants. more...

482. A programmable pAgo nuclease with universal guide and target specificity from the mesophilic bacterium Kurthia massiliensis
(Submitter supplied) Argonaute proteins are programmable nucleases that are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes and provide defense against invading genetic elements. Although some prokaryotic Argonautes (pAgos) were shown to recognize RNA targets in vitro, the majority of studied pAgos have strict specificity toward DNA, which limits their practical use in RNA-centric applications. Here, we describe a unique pAgo nuclease, KmAgo, from the mesophilic bacterium Kurthia massiliensis that can be programmed with either DNA or RNA guides and can precisely cleave both DNA and RNA targets. more...

512. Response of E. coli to m-Tyrosine
(Submitter supplied) To ensure faithful translation of the genetic code, some aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have a quality control (QC) mechanism that allows them to remove similarly shaped, non-protein amino acids (NPAs) from a mischarged tRNA.  In E. coli, the QC function of phenyalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS) is required for resistantce to the toxic NPA, meta-Tyrosine (m-Tyr).  Here, we sought to understand the mechanism of m-Tyr toxicity. more...

516. A multi-level understanding of the evolutionary trade-offs in thermal adaptation
(Submitter supplied) The hypothesis that increased fitness within a selective environment must be accompanied by a loss of fitness in other non-selective environments leads to the notion of evolutionary tradeoffs. Experimental evolution provides an approach to test the existence of evolutionary tradeoffs, characterize their general quality, and reveal their genetic origins. To examine the underlying mechanism for a fitness trade-off, we constructed the evolutionary trajectories of Escherichia coli K-12 at increasing temperatures up to 45.3°C, and found diverging mutational histories that led to adaptive phenotypes with and without fitness trade-offs at low temperatures. more...

(Submitter supplied) Cellular RNA levels result from the interplay of RNA transcription, processing, and degradation. Multiple complementary methods have been developed to dissect these tightly regulated processes. One of the methods exploits chemically active nucleoside analogs (i.e., noncanonical nucleosides) to metabolically label newly transcribed RNA. The labeled RNA are then chemically conjugated with fluorophores for imaging or affinity tags for enrichment and sequencing, which allow for studying transcription by separation of nascent RNA from the pre-existing populations. more...

We found that E. coli responds similarly to both CAMPs and ceragenins by inducing a Cpx envelope stress response. However, whereas E. coli exposed to CAMPs increased expression of genes involved in colanic acid biosynthesis, bacteria exposed to ceragenins specifically modulated functions related to phosphate transport, indicating distinct mechanisms of action between these two classes of molecules. more...

536. RRF plays critical roles in ribosome homeostasis in E. coli but has little effect on translational coupling
(Submitter supplied) We used ribosome profiling to characterize the biological role of ribosome recycling factor (RRF) in Escherichia coli. As expected, RRF depletion leads to enrichment of post-termination 70S complexes in 3′-UTRs. We also observe that elongating ribosomes are unable to complete translation because they are blocked by non-recycled ribosomes at stop codons. Previous studies have suggested a role for recycling in translational coupling within operons; if a ribosome remains bound to an mRNA after termination, it may re-initiate downstream. more...

(Submitter supplied) Previous high-throughput studies in Gram-negative bacteria identified a large number of 3’UTR fragments that potentially function as sRNAs. Here we extensively characterise the MalH sRNA. We show that MalH is a stable degradation intermediate derived from the 3’ end of malG, which is part of the maltose uptake operon transcript malEFG. Unlike the majority of bacterial sRNAs, MalH is transiently expressed during the transition from the exponential to the stationary growth phase, suggesting that it contributes to adaptation to changes in nutrient availability. more...

The later can lead to potentially fatal renal failure and is caused by the release of Shiga toxins that are encoded within lambdoid bacteriophages. The toxins are encoded within the late transcript of the phage and are regulated by anti-termination of the PR’ late promoter during lytic induction of the phage. more...

559. Structural and biochemical analyses of Caulobacter crescentus ParB reveal the role of its N-terminal domain in chromosome segregation
(Submitter supplied) The tripartite ParA-ParB-parS complex ensures faithful chromosome segregation in the majority of bacterial species. ParB nucleates on the centromere-like parS site and spreads to neighboring DNA to form a network of protein-DNA complexes. This nucleoprotein network in turn interacts with ParA to partition the parS locus, hence the chromosome to each daughter cell. Here, we determine the co-crystal structure of the C-terminal domain truncated ParB-parS complex from Caulobacter crescentus, and show that its N-terminal domain is inherently flexible and adopts multiple different conformations. more...

581. Mapping PT modifications in bacteria
(Submitter supplied) One microbial organism always contains multiple DNA modification systems as defense strategies or epigenetic controls. Here, we describe crosstalk between two distinct DNA modifications with different target sequence motif: DNA phosphorothioation (PT, GPSAAC/GPSTTC by DndACDE proteins) and N6-methyl-adenine methylation (m6A, G6mATC by Dam protein). By using a newly developed DNA modification sequencing method PT nick-seq, we found that half of PT modifications change from GAAC/GTTC to GATC sites after bacteria have lost Dam.

612. Translational initiation in E. coli occurs at the correct sites genome-wide in the absence of mRNA-rRNA base-pairing
(Submitter supplied) Shine-Dalgarno (SD) motifs are thought to play an important role in translational initiation in bacteria. Paradoxically, ribosome profiling studies in E. coli show no correlation between the strength of the SD in an mRNA and how efficiently it is translated. Performing profiling on ribosomes with altered anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequences, we reveal a genome-wide correlation between SD strength and ribosome occupancy that was previously masked by other contributing factors. more...

632. Identification of potential tobramycin-resistant mutagenesis of Escherichia coli strains after spaceflight
(Submitter supplied) Background: This study aimed to explore potential tobramycin-resistant mutagenesis of Escherichia coli (E. coli) strains after spaceflight. Methods: A spaceflight-induced mutagenesis of multi-drug resistant E.coli strain (T1_13) on the outer space for 64 days (ST5), and a ground laboratory with the same conditions (GT5) were conducted. Both whole-genome sequencing and RNA-sequencing were performed. Results: A total of 75 SNPs and 20 InDels were found to be associated with the resistance mechanism. Compared to T1_13, 1242 genes were differentially expressed in more than 20 of 38 tobramycin-resistant E. coli isolates while not in GT5. Function annotation of these SNPs/InDels related genes and differentially expressed genes was performed. Conclusion: This study provided clues for potential tobramycin-resistant spaceflight-induced mutagenesis of E. coli.

Exoribonucleases are key enzymes in the transition between the two growth phases. PNPase, RNase R and RNase II are the major degradative exoribonucleases in Escherichia coli. We analysed the whole transcriptome of exponential and stationary phases from the WT and mutants lacking these exoribonucleases (Δpnp, Δrnr, Δrnb, and ΔrnbΔrnr). more...

643. Genetically diverse uropathogenic Escherichia coli adopt a common transcriptional program in patients with urinary tract infections
(Submitter supplied) Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) is the major causative agent of uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). A common virulence genotype of UPEC strains responsible for UTIs is yet to be defined, due to the large variation of virulence factors observed in UPEC strains. We hypothesized that studying UPEC functional responses in patients might reveal universal UPEC features that enable pathogenesis. more...

(Submitter supplied) Histones are a principal constituent of chromatin in eukaryotes and fundamental to our understanding of eukaryotic gene regulation. In archaea, histones are phylogenetically widespread but not universal: several archaeal lineages have independently lost histone genes. What prompted or facilitated these losses and how archaea without histones organize their chromatin remains largely unknown. Here, we use micrococcal nuclease digestion of native and reconstituted chromatin to elucidate primary chromatin architecture in an archaeon without histones, the acido-thermophilic archaeon Thermoplasma acidophilum. more...

672. Polynucleotide phosphorylase promotes the stability and function of Hfq-binding sRNAs by degrading target mRNA-derived fragments
(Submitter supplied) In many gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) that bind the RNA chaperone Hfq have a pivotal role in modulating virulence, stress responses, metabolism, and biofilm formation. These sRNAs recognize transcripts through base-pairing, and sRNA-mRNA annealing consequently alters the translation and/or stability of transcripts leading to changes in gene expression. We have previously found that the highly conserved 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) has an indispensable role in paradoxically stabilizing Hfq-bound sRNAs and promoting their function in gene regulation in Escherichia coli. more...

708. Isolating the Escherichia coli transcriptomic responses to superoxide generation and stress from cadmium chalcogenide quantum dots
(Submitter supplied) In this study we investigate the transcriptomic response of Escherichia coli to CdTe-2.4 and benign CdSe-2.4 quantum dots, each with and without illumination to elucidate the phototherapeutic effect of CdTe-2.4. Our analysis sought to separate the transcriptomic responses of E. coli to the presence of superoxide and the presence of cadmium chalcogenide nanoparticles. We found eight genes to be consistently differentially expressed as a response to superoxide generation, and these genes demonstrate a consistent association with the DNA damage response and deactivation of iron-sulfur clusters, characteristic of a superoxide response. more...

738. Investigation of spatial vulnerabilities of Bacterium Escherichia coli genome to spontaneous mutations by molecularly barcoded deep Sequencing
(Submitter supplied) Investigation of spontaneous mutations by Next-Generation Sequencing technology has attracted extensive attention lately due to the fundamental roles of spontaneous mutations in evolution and pathological processes. However, these studies only focused on the mutations accumulated through many generations during long term --could be years of-- culturing, but not the freshly-generated spontaneous mutations that occurs at very low frequencies. more...

740. The small protein MgtS and small RNA MgrR modulate the PitA phosphate symporter to boost intracellular magnesium levels
(Submitter supplied) In response to low levels of magnesium (Mg2+), the PhoQP two component system induces the transcription of two convergent genes, one encoding a 31-amino acid protein denoted MgtS and the second encoding a small, regulatory RNA (sRNA) denoted MgrR. Previous studies showed that the MgtS protein interacts with and stabilizes the MgtA Mg2+ importer to increase intracellular Mg2+ levels, while the MgrR sRNA base pairs with the eptB mRNA thus affecting lipopolysaccharide modification. more...

743. The mechanistic basis of diverse, environmentally dependent genetic interaction in a metabolic pathway
(Submitter supplied) Metabolic imbalances underlie a large spectrum of diseases, spanning congenital and chronic conditions and cancer. Our ability to explain and predict such imbalances remains severely limited by the diversity of underlying mutation effects and their dependence on the genetic background and environment, but it is unclear whether these complicating factors can be reduced to simple quantitative rules. To characterise their interplay in determining cell physiology and fitness, we systematically quantified almost 4,000 interactions between expression variants of two genes of a well-known sugar-utilisation pathway containing a toxic metabolite in the model bacterium, Escherichia coli, in different environments. more...

(Submitter supplied) Bacterial small RNAs (sRNAs) are post-transcriptional regulators of stress response, virulence and more. The activity of sRNAs must be maintained across diverse environmental conditions, including the range of temperatures that defines the thermal niche of the species.  Here we characterize the effects of temperature on the specificity and efficiency of sRNA regulation in E. coli. By measuring the activity of a large-scale library of sRNA variants at different temperatures, we found that many mutations have a significant but temperature-independent effect. more...

From the results we found that different frequency signals through the SIMO module resulted in distinct gene expressions. Moreover, the PCA result showed a significant difference between frequency response gene expression profiles under the wildtype and the mutant EnvZHK SIMO module that the gene expression profile of the wildtype samples under middle frequencies were closer to that under high frequencies, while the gene expression profile of the mutant samples under middle frequencies were closer to that under low frequencies. more...

(Submitter supplied) Essentiality assays are commonly practiced as important tools for the discovery of gene functions. Growth/no growth screens of single gene knockout strain collections are often utilized to test the predictive power of genome-scale models. False positive predictions occur when computational analysis predicts a gene to be non-essential, however experimental screens deem the gene to be essential. One explanation for this inconsistency is that the model contains the wrong information, possibly an incorrectly annotated alternative pathway or isozyme reaction. more...

772. A stress response that monitors and regulates mRNA structure is central to cold-shock adaptation
(Submitter supplied) Temperature influences the structural and functional properties of cellular components, necessitating stress responses to restore homeostasis following temperature shift. The heat shock circuitry is well understood, but that controlling the E. coli cold-shock adaptation program is not.  We found that during the growth arrest phase (acclimation) that follows shift to low temperature, protein synthesis increases and ORF-wide mRNA secondary structure decreases. more...

(Submitter supplied) Enterohaemorrhagic E. coli is a significant human pathogen that utilises a type 3 secretion system (T3S) to colonise the reservoir host, cattle, and humans. Transposon mutagenesis showed the ybeZYX-Int operon to be required for normal T3S levels. Deletion analyses identified the endoribonuclease ybeY, which was previously linked to 16S ribosomal RNA maturation and small RNA (sRNA) function. Loss of ybeY in EHEC had additional pleiotropic effects, including temperature sensitivity and reduced growth. more...

774. The RNA-binding protein Hfq is important for ribosome biogenesis and affects translation fidelity
(Submitter supplied) Ribosome biogenesis is a complex and intricate process involving multiple factors. A plethora of auxiliary proteins assist the correct assembly of rRNA and ribosomal proteins into mature ribosomes. Defects in this process cause dysfunctional ribosomes which may alter protein synthesis and impair cell fitness. Despite its importance, yet we are lacking mechanistic details of ribosome biogenesis. Here we show that the widely-conserved RNA chaperone Hfq, which is an important post-transcriptional regulator in sRNA-mRNA basepairing in Escherichia coli, plays a critical role in rRNA processing and consequently ribosome assembly. more...

(Submitter supplied) RelA/SpoT Homologs (RSHs) are ubiquitous bacterial enzymes that synthesize and hydrolyze (p)ppGpp in response to environmental challenges. Bacteria cannot survive in hosts and produce infection without activating the (p)ppGpp-mediated stringent response, but it is not yet understood how the enzymatic activities of RSHs are controlled. Using UV crosslinking and deep sequencing, we show that Escherichia coli RelA [(p)ppGpp synthetase I] interacts with uncharged tRNA during steady-state cell growth without being activated. more...

Intrinsic terminators are composed of a stem-loop RNA structure followed by a uridine stretch and are known to terminate in a precise manner. In contrast, Rho-dependent terminators have more loosely defined characteristics and are thought to terminate in a diffuse manner. While transcripts ending in an intrinsic terminator are protected from 3’-5’ exonuclease digestion due to the stem-loop structure of the terminator, it remains unclear what protects Rho-dependent transcripts from being degraded. more...

APEC mainly use two-component regulatory systems (TCSs) to deal with the stressing environments in host during their infection. Whereas most TCSs in E.coli are well characterized, the characterization of RstA/RstB in APEC has not been thoroughly investigated. To understand the whole picture of RstA/RstB regulation, especially its role in virulence regulation, transcriptional analysis of the effect of rstAB deletion was performed in vivo. more...

834. Comparative Transcriptomic Profiling of Antimicrobial Resistant and Virulent   Escherichia coli of Poultry Origin
(Submitter supplied) To characterize the differentially expressed genes between pathogenic avian E. coli and human E. coli ATCC 25922, Abstract   Escherichia coli (E. coli) is a harmless common bacterium of poultry intestine, but with a wide range of genomic flexibility, is also causative agent of many poultry diseases collectively called colibacillosis that is blamed for high economic loss in poultry sector worldwide. Numerous studies have been conducted to check the prevalence of pathogenic E. coli in poultry and poultry products, however limited data are available regarding their resistance and virulence associated genes expression profile. This study examined the pathogenomic content of poultry E. coli by antibiotic susceptibility, biofilm formation and adhesion, invasion and intracellular survivability assays in Caco-2 and Raw 264.7 cell lines along with the determination of median lethal dose in two-day old chickens. A clinical pathogenic multidrug resistant (MDR) isolate, E. coli 381, isolated from broilers was found to be highly virulent in cell culture and in chicken model. Transcriptome analysis has been skewed towards bacterial pathogens because of the prioritization of poultry diseases. Comparative gene expression profile of MDR E. coli 381 and the reference human strain E. coli ATCC 25922 was done using Illumina HiSeq2500 transcriptome  and results were verified by RT-qPCR analyses. A number of resistant encoding genes including multidrug transporters, multidrug resistance proteins, porins and autotransporters were identified. We also noticed overexpression of very important virulent genes (fimA, fimC, fimH and fimI) encoding the type-1 fimbrial proteins, curli fimbriae genes , invasin genes, toxin-encoding genes and biofilm forming regulatory genes . In addition, many types of stress  and metal homeostasis controlling genes were among up-regulated genes in E. coli 381 as compared to reference strain. GO and KEGG pathway analysis results revealed that genes controlling secondary metabolism, drug transport, adhesion and invasion proteins, and mobile genetic elements were over-expressed in E. coli 381. Several genes involved in cellular and metabolic processes such as carbohydrate metabolism were responsible for stress tolerance. Seminal description of the transcriptomic results and other unique features of E. coli 381 confirmed that it is highly virulent and MDR strain of poultry origin. This comparative study provides new avenues for further work on molecular mechanisms to prevent resistance development in bacteria and to ensure public health.

847. The Nucleoid Protein Dps Binds Genomic DNA of Escherichia coli in a Non-random Manner
(Submitter supplied) Dps is a multifunctional homododecameric protein that oxidizes Fe2+ ions accumulating them in the form of Fe2O3 within its protein cavity, interacts with DNA tightly condensing bacterial nucleoid upon starvation and performs some other functions. Ferroxidase activity of Dps is rather well studied, but the mechanism of Dps interaction with DNA still remains enigmatic. Using the ChIP-seq data presented here, we found a non-random distribution of Dps binding sites in the bacterial chromosome of exponentially growing cells and showed their enrichment with inverted repeats prone to form secondary structures. more...

(Submitter supplied) cAMP receptor protein (CRP, also known as the catabolite activator protein [CAP]) is arguably the best-studied of the global transcription factors of E coli. CRP alone is responsible for regulating at least 283 operons. Upon binding cAMP, the CRP dimer binds DNA and directly interacts with RNA polymerase (RNAP). At Class II promoters, CRP binds near position -41,5 relative to the  transcription start site and contacts the amino-terminal domain of the RNAP α subunit (RNAPα-NTD). more...

The three bacterial release factors (RFs) play key roles:  RF1 and 2 recognize stop codons and terminate translation; and RF3 promotes disassociation of bound release factors. Probing release factors mutations with reporter constructs containing programmed frameshifting sequences or premature stop codons had revealed a propensity for readthrough or frameshifting at these specific sites, but their effects on translation genome-wide have not been examined. more...

To detect potentially translated RNAs, we developed an improved protocol for bacterial ribosomal footprinting (RIBOseq). This allowed distinguishing ncRNA from mRNA in EHEC. A high ratio of ribosomal footprints per transcript (ribosomal coverage value, RCV) is expected to indicate a translated RNA, while a low RCV should point to a non-translated RNA. more...

Here we demonstrate that a bacterial protein, transcription terminator Rho of Clostridium botulinum (Cb-Rho), can form a prion. Specifically, we identify a candidate prion-forming domain (cPrD) in Cb-Rho and show that it confers amyloidogenicity on Cb-Rho and can functionally replace the PrD of a yeast prion-forming protein. more...

Heterologous expression of eukaryotic molecular chaperons protects Escherichia coli against heat stress. Here we report that expression of the plant E3 ligase BnTR1 significantly increase the thermotolerance of Escherichia coli. Different from eukaryotic chaperones, BnTR1 post-transcriptionally regulates the heat shock factor σ32 though zinc fingers of the RING domain, which interacts with DnaK resulting in stabilizing σ32 and subsequently up-regulating heat shock proteins. more...

974. Psoralen binding across the Escherichia coli chromosome
(Submitter supplied) We used trimethylpsoralen intercalation to map supercoiling across the E. coli chromosome. We treated E. coli cells with trimethylpsoralen and exposed them to UV light. Psoralen enters cells, intercalates between DNA base pairs, and crosslinks the two strands of DNA at a rate proportional to the local superhelical density. We then fragmented DNA and hybridized crosslinked and non-crosslinked DNA fragments separately to tiling microarrays.

979. Gene expression analysis of E. coli strains provides insights into the role of gene regulation in diversification
(Submitter supplied) Escherichia coli spans a genetic continuum from enteric strains to several phylogenetically distinct, atypical lineages that are rare in humans, but more common in extra-intestinal environments. To investigate the link between gene regulation, phylogeny and diversification in this species, we analyzed global gene expression profiles of four strains representing distinct evolutionary lineages, including a well-studied laboratory strain, a typical commensal (enteric) strain and two environmental strains. more...

981. The Epigenomic Landscape of Prokaryotes
(Submitter supplied) DNA methylation is an important regulator of genome function in the eukaryotes, but it is currently unclear if the same is true in prokaryotes. While regulatory functions have been demonstrated for a small number of bacteria, there have been no large-scale studies of prokaryotic methylomes and the full repertoire of targets and biological functions of DNA methylation remains unclear. Here we applied single-molecule, real-time sequencing to directly study the methylomes of 232 phylogenetically diverse prokaryotes. more...

982. Gene expression changes during overexpression of bacterial small RNA, DicF
(Submitter supplied) Hundreds of small RNAs (sRNAs) have been identified in diverse bacterial species, and while the functions of most remain unknown, some regulate key processes, particularly stress responses. The sRNA DicF was identified over twenty-five years ago as an inhibitor of cell division, but since then has remained uncharacterized. DicF is 53 nucleotides and is encoded on a prophage (Qin) in the genomes of many Escherichia coli strains. more...

983. Clarifying the translational pausing landscape in bacteria by ribosome profiling
(Submitter supplied) The rate of protein synthesis varies according to the mRNA sequence in ways that affect gene expression. Global analysis of translational pausing is now possible with ribosome profiling. Here, we revisit an earlier report that Shine-Dalgarno sequences are the major determinant of translational pausing in bacteria. Using refinements in the profiling method as well as biochemical assays, we find that SD motifs have little (if any) effect on elongation rates. more...

984. Polynucleotide phosphorylase can interact with small noncoding RNAs in both stabilizing and degradative modes
(Submitter supplied) In all bacterial species examined thusfar, small regulatory RNAs (sRNAs) contribute to intricate patterns of genetic regulation. Many of the actions of these nucleic acids are mediated by chaperones such as the Hfq protein, and genetic screens have identified the exoribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase) as a stabilizer and facilitator of sRNAs in vivo. We observe that the protective and facilitating effects of PNPase in vivo require the RNA-binding KH and S1 domains and the catalytic site, suggesting a requirement for physical interation of the ribonuclease with either the sRNA itself or other RNAs acting upstream of the process. more...

995. Identification of a gene cluster involved in the utilization of phenylpropanoids in Corynebacterium glutamicum [set1]
(Submitter supplied) DNA microarray experiments with phenylpropanoid pulses were performed in order to get hints on expression of relevant genes or gene clusters activated in presence of phenylpropanoid compounds. We determined the relative mRNA-levels of wild-type cells confronted with phenylpropanoids and unpulsed cells. A pulsing time of 30 minutes was sufficient to find regulation of gene expression in response to the phenylpropanoid amount of 5 mM (final concentration) added. more...

(Submitter supplied) Messenger RNA acts as an informational molecule between DNA and translating ribosomes. Emerging evidence places mRNA in central cellular processes beyond its major function as informational entity. Although individual examples show that specific structural features of mRNA regulate translation and transcript stability, their role and function throughout the bacterial transcriptome remains unknown. Combining three sequencing approaches to provide a high resolution view of global mRNA secondary structure, translation efficiency and mRNA abundance, we unraveled structural features in E. more...

1030. Expression profiles of dnaA null, rok null, and dnaA null; rok null mutants
(Submitter supplied) To identify potential targets of co-regulation by DnaA and Rok, we compared the transcriptional profiles of dnaA null, rok null, and dnaA null rok null mutants.  Because a dnaA null mutant requires an oriC- strain background, we used an oriC- oriN+ background for all strains, to allow direct comparisons.

We found that established dNTP pool changes resulting from deficiencies in the ndk or dcd genes,  had a strongly suppressive effect on the recA730 mutator effect. To investigate whether the observed reduction in SOS mutator effect is due to lowered expression of the entire SOS regulon, we performed microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in each of the single ndk, dcd, and recA730 strains, as well as the double recA730 ndk and recA730 dcd strains.

1058. Oxidative stress in E. coli K-12 and O157
(Submitter supplied) Escherichia coli O157 presents a number of specific problems in terms of food safety and public health. It has been found that E. coli O157 is more resistant to a number of the stresses encountered during food production such as heat, pH and osmotic shock. This greater resistance is thought to contribute to the low infectious dose of E. coli O157 (<100 organisms). Moreover, E. coli O157 is associated with debilitating conditions such as haemorrhagic colitis and haemoytic uraemic syndrome, particularly in children and the elderly. more...

However, it is not known whether the same forces also drive the evolution of non-coding regulatory regions. Here we demonstrate that regulatory region can ‘switch’ between non-homologous alternatives and that such switching is ubiquitous, occurring across the bacterial domain. more...

1095. Comparison of strand-specific transcriptomes of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 EDL933 (EHEC) under eleven different environmental conditions
(Submitter supplied) Multiple infection sources for enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 are known, including food of animal origin and produce. The ecology of this pathogen outside its human host is largely unknown. One third of its annotated genes still are hypothetical. To identify genetic determinants expressed under environmental factors, we applied strand-specific RNA-sequencing of strain E. coli EDL933 under 11 different biotic and abiotic conditions: LB medium at pH4, pH7, pH9, or at 15°C; LB with nitrite or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole; LB-agar surface, M9 minimal medium, spinach leaf juice, surface of living radish sprouts, and cattle feces. more...

(Submitter supplied) Ribosomes elongate at a nonuniform rate during translation. Theoretical models and experiments disagree on the in vivo determinants of elongation rate and the mechanism by which elongation rate affects protein levels. To resolve this conflict, we measured transcriptome-wide ribosome occupancy under multiple conditions and used it to formulate a whole-cell model of translation in E. coli. Our model predicts that elongation rates at most codons during nutrient-rich growth are not limited by the intracellular concentrations of aminoacyl-tRNAs. more...

We developed an algorithm to evaluate genome-wide polymerase progression independently of local noise, and used it to reveal that the transcription factor DksA inhibits promoter-proximal pausing and increases RNAP elongation when uncoupled from translation by depletion of charged tRNAs. more...

1128. Antibiotics induce redox-related physiological alterations as part of their lethality
(Submitter supplied) Deeper understanding of antibiotic-induced physiological responses is critical to identifying means for enhancing our current antibiotic arsenal. Bactericidal antibiotics with diverse targets have been hypothesized to kill bacteria, in part, by inducing production of damaging reactive species. This notion has been supported by many groups, but recently challenged. Here we robustly test the hypothesis using biochemical, enzymatic and biophysical assays along with genetic and phenotypic experiments. more...

1165. DNA microarray analysis of E.coli K12 MG1655 exposed to prolonged stationary phase
(Submitter supplied) This study explores the effects of prolonged stationary phase, on whole genome expression of Escherichia coli. In summary these results imply that prolonged stationary phase cells have shown less growth rate compared to fresh cells due to the low abundance of transcripts for translation initiation factor infC, and for all the seven rrn operons of 5S, 16S, 23S ribosomal RNA which further delayed in protein synthesis leading to low biomass in prolonged stationary phase cells.

1179. Avoiding chromosome pathology when replication forks collide
(Submitter supplied) Chromosome duplication normally initiates via the assembly of replication fork complexes at defined origins. DNA synthesis by any one fork is thought to cease when it meets another travelling in the opposite direction, at which stage the replication machinery may simply dissociate before the nascent strands are finally ligated. But what actually happens is not clear. Here we present evidence consistent with the idea that every fork collision has the potential to trigger re-replication of the already replicated DNA, thus posing a threat to genomic integrity. more...

1237. Effect of simulated microgravity on E. coli K12 MG1655 growth and gene expression
(Submitter supplied) This study demonstrates simulated microgravity effects on E. coli K 12 MG1655 when grown on LB medium supplemented with glycerol. The results imply that E. coli readily reprograms itself to combat the multiple stresses imposed due to microgravity. Under these conditions it survives by upregulating oxidative stress protecting genes and simultaneously down regulating the membrane transporters and synthases to maintain cell homeostasis.

Here we demonstrate that acetylation enables the reference bacterium Escherichia coli to withstand environmental stress. Specifically, the bacterium reaches higher cell densities and becomes more resistant to heat and oxidative stress when its proteins are acetylated, as shown by deletion of the gene encoding acetyltransferase YfiQ and the gene encoding deacetylase CobB, as well as by overproducing YfiQ and CobB. more...

(Submitter supplied) Persisters are a subpopulation of metabolically-dormant cells in biofilms that are resistant to antibiotics; hence, understanding persister cell formation is important for controlling bacterial infections. Previously we discerned that MqsR and MqsA of Escherichia coli are a toxin/antitoxin pair that influence persister cell production via their regulation of Hha, CspD, and HokA. Here, to gain more insights into the origin of persisters, we used protein engineering to increase the toxicity of toxin MqsR by reasoning it would be easier to understand the effect of this toxin if it were more toxic. more...

1266. The anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence drives translational pausing and codon choice in bacteria
(Submitter supplied) Protein synthesis by ribosomes takes place on a linear substrate but at variable speeds. Transient pausing of ribosomes can impact a variety of co-translational processes, including protein targeting and folding. These pauses are influenced by the sequence of the mRNA. Thus redundancy in the genetic code allows the same protein to be translated at different rates. However, our knowledge of both the position and the mechanism of translational pausing in vivo is highly limited. more...

1309. Bile Salts Influence Virulence Properties of E. coli O157:H7
(Submitter supplied) Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), including serotype O157:H7, cause severe food-borne illness. On route to the human colon, they encounter and resist, numerous anti-microbial ingestion stresses. We hypothesize that these stresses cue EHEC to alter virulence properties. This study investigated the impact of bile salts on virulence properties and examined the genetic basis of the phenotypes. Established assays were used to examine adhesion to human epithelial cells, motility, verotoxin (VT) production and antimicrobial resistance with/without bile salt stress. Bacteria treated for 90 minute in DMEM plus 0.15% (w/v) bile salt mix demonstrated significantly enhanced adhesion to epithelial cells and resistance to several antibiotics but did not increase motility or VT production. To determine the genetic basis of these phenotypes a microarray experiment was conducted. EHEC strain 86-24, in mid-log phase of growth, were grown in DMEM pH 7.4 (control), or DMEM plus bile salt mix (0.15% w/v), for 90 minutes, statically at 37˚C, 5% CO2 prior to harvesting RNA for the microarray study. Four biological replicates were produced for each treatment. Microarray and gene expression analysis (semi-quantitative RT-PCR and beta-galactosidase reporter assays) of bile salt-treated EHEC revealed significant up-regulation of genes for lipid A modification, fimbriae, an efflux pump, and a two-component regulatory system relative to the bacteria grown in DMEM alone. This work points to several mechanisms that EHEC employs to resist the stresses of the human small intestine, notably efflux, antimicrobial resistance, and outer membrane alterations. Bile salts enhanced the virulence-related properties of increased adhesion and resistance to antimicrobials but not VT production or motility. This research contributes to our understanding of how EHEC senses and responds to host environmental signals and the mechanisms this pathogen uses to successfully colonize and infect the human host.

APEC isolates are closely related to human extraintestinal pathogenic E.coli strains and may also act as pathogens for humans. In this work, three type VI secretion systems were deleted to analyze which pathogenicity characteristics would change in the mutants, compared to wild type strain (SEPT 362).

1369. QseA regulation of virulence factors in EHEC 
(Submitter supplied) Enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) colonizes the large intestine and causes attaching and effacing lesions (AE). Most of the genes involved in the formation of AE lesions are encoded within a chromosomal pathogenicity island termed the Locus of Enterocyte Effacement (LEE). The LysR-like transcriptional factor QseA regulates the LEE by binding directly to the regulatory region of ler. Here, we performed transcriptome analyses comparing WT EHEC and the isogenic qseA mutant in order to elucidate the extent of QseA’s role in gene regulation in EHEC. more...

1370. Systems biology approach reveals that overflow metabolism of acetate in Escherichia coli is triggered by carbon catabolite repression of acetyl-CoA synthetase
(Submitter supplied) Background: The biotechnology industry has extensively exploited Escherichia coli for producing recombinant proteins, biofuels etc. However, high growth rate aerobic E. coli cultivations are accompanied by acetate excretion i.e. overflow metabolism which is harmful as it inhibits growth, diverts valuable carbon from biomass formation and is detrimental for target product synthesis. Although overflow metabolism has been studied for decades, its regulation mechanisms still remain unclear. more...

(Submitter supplied) n-Butanol has been proposed as an alternative biofuel to ethanol, and both Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae have been engineered to produce it.  Unfortunately, n-butanol is more toxic than ethanol to these organisms.  To understand the basis for its toxicity, cell wide studies were conducted at the transcript, protein and metabolite levels to obtain a global view of the n-butanol stress response. more...

1406. Reprogramming of anaerobic metabolism by the FnrS Small RNA
(Submitter supplied) Small RNAs (sRNA) that act by base pairing with trans-encoded mRNAs modulate metabolism in response to a variety of environmental stimuli.  Here, we describe an Hfq-binding sRNA (FnrS) whose expression is induced upon a shift from aerobic to anaerobic conditions and which acts to down regulate the levels of a variety of mRNAs encoding metabolic enzymes.  Anaerobic induction in minimal medium depends strongly on FNR but is also affected by ArcA and CRP. more...

1408. Expression data from E. coli cells overexpressing GraL for long periods of time
(Submitter supplied) While studying greA expression, we noted presence of an intrinsic terminator in the leader region of greA mRNA transcript. We found this terminator to be quite efficient both in vivo and in vitro. This region seems to be conserved among many enteric bacteria. Judging from fitness experiments, the resulting short RNAs (50-59nt long) exert biological effects. This lead us to propose that greA leader region encodes a novel small non-coding RNA that we collectively call GraL. more...

(Submitter supplied) Variant FhlA133 (Q11H, L14V, Y177F, K245R, M288K, and I342F) had eight- fold higher hydrogen production than FhlA wild-type under 30 min of anaerobic incubation in modified-complex 20 mM formate at 37ºC. The mechanism by which the FhlA133 mutations increase hydrogen production is by increasing the transcription of all of the genes activated by the native FhlA (FHL complex).

1414. Effects on small RNA MgrR in Escherichia coli
(Submitter supplied) MgrR is a newly characterized Hfq dependent small RNA RNA.  The expression of MgrR is regulated by Two component system, PhoPQ regulon, which senses low Mg2+ in environment. It has been reported that  Hfq-binding sRNAs base pair with target RNAs, frequently leading to rapid degradation of target messages or, less frequently, to stabilization, both of which can be assayed by using microarrays.  In order to search for the target genes of MgrR, we therefore examined the consequences of MgrR expression on mRNA abundance under two conditions. more...

1415. Evolution of E. coli transcriptome under osmotic-stress with and without RpoS
(Submitter supplied) The RpoS sigma factor protein of Escherichia coli is the master transcriptional regulator of physiological responses to a variety of stresses.  This stress response comes at the expense of scavenging for scarce resources, causing a trade-off between stress tolerance and nutrient acquisition.  This trade-off favors non-functional rpoS alleles in nutrient-poor environments. We used experimental evolution to explore how natural selection modifies the regulatory network of strains lacking RpoS when they are evolved in an osmotically stressful environment. more...

1416. E. coli BW25113 K-12 hfq vs. wild-type persister
(Submitter supplied) Persisters are cells which evade stresses like antibiotics and which are characterized by reduced metabolism and a lack of genetic alterations required to achieve this state.  We showed previously that MqsR and MqsA of Escherichia coli are a toxin-antitoxin pair that influence cell physiology (e.g., biofilm formation and motility) via RNase activity as well as through regulation of toxin CspD.  Here, we show that deletion of the mqsRA locus decreases persister cell formation and, consistent with this result, overexpression of MqsR increases persister cell formation. more...

(Submitter supplied) Alkylation damage to DNA occurs when cells encounter alkylating agents in the environment or when active alkylators are generated by nitrosation of amino acids in metabolic pathways. To cope with DNA alkylation damage, cells have evolved genes that encode proteins with alkylation-specific DNA repair activities. It is notable that these repair systems are conserved from bacteria to humans.  In Escherichia coli, cells exposed to a low concentration of an alkylating agent, such as N-methyl-N’-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG) or methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), show a remarkable increase in resistance to both the lethal and mutagenic effects of subsequent high-level challenge treatments with the same or other alkylating agents. more...

An in-depth knowledge of the microbiology involved in this process is likely to be crucial to understand and optimize the factors most influencing bioremediation. Here, we compared two distinct large-scale field bioremediation experiments, located at Alert (ex situ approach) and Eureka (in situ approach), in the Canadian high Arctic. more...

Some gene complexes force their maintenance on the host bacterial cells by killing cells that have lost them. This form of programmed death called post-segregational killing or genetic addiction is brought about by several Type II restriction-modification gene complexes, through restriction attack on the undermethylated chromosome, and underlie their behavior as selfish mobile elements. more...

(Submitter supplied) Escherichia coli O157:H7 strains have been classified into different genotypes based on the presence of specific shiga toxin-encoding bacteriophage insertion sites.  Genotypes that are predominant in clinical isolates are named clinical genotypes and those that are isolated mostly from bovine sources are bovine-biased genotypes. To determine whether inherent differences in gene expression could possibly explain the variation in infectivity of these genotypes, we compared the expression patterns of O157:H7 strains isolated from cattle, which belonged to either clinical genotype 1 or bovine-biased genotype 5. more...

1466. Amino acid/Nucleotide perturbation in Escherichia coli
(Submitter supplied) Wild-type E. coli are prototrophic for all amino acid and nucleotides. These are synthesized by a network of interconnected metabolic pathways from a handful precursors molecules, which are regulated at the level of gene expression. It was hypothesized in this study, that since metabolic pathways are interconnected, transcriptional regulation should be shared across multiple pathways. To uncover these regulatory interactions, cells growing at steady state were perturbed by the addition of an end-metabolite (aa or nt), and were allowed to recover. more...

1476. Transcript Analysis of E. coli ATCC 35218 suggest a Role of cranberry Juice in Inhibiting the growth of E. coli
(Submitter supplied) Several different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the possible role of cranberries, cranberry juice, and cranberry extracts in inhibiting bacterial growth.  In this report, we showed that Escherichia coli showed slower growth rate in response to the presence of cranberry juice in the growth media. By compareing the global transcript profiles, significant modulation of several genes of E. coli grown in LB broth with 10% cranberry juice were identified and provided identification of the potential mechanisms involved in the inhibitory effects of cranberry juice. more...

1492. Ion transport and osmotic adjustment in E. coli in response to ionic and non-ionic osmotica
(Submitter supplied) Bacteria respond to osmotic stress by a substantial increase in the intracellular osmolality, adjusting their cell turgor for altered growth conditions. Using E. coli as a model organism we demonstrate here that bacterial responses to hyperosmotic stress specifically depend on the nature of osmoticum used. We show that increasing acute hyperosmotic NaCl stress above ~1.0 Os kg-1 causes a dose-dependent K+ leak from the cell, resulting in a substantial decrease in cytosolic K+ content and a concurrent accumulation of Na+ in the cell. more...

(Submitter supplied) E. coli K-12 BW25113 mutant strain hha expression in biofilm cells relative to E. coli wild-type strain expression in biofilm cells. Samples were cultured in LB with glasswool at 37C for 4 hours and in LB glu with glasswool at 37C for 4, 15 and 24 hours.  Hha is a temperature- and osmolarity-dependent modulator of gene expression that is induced 30-fold in Escherichia coli biofilms. Here we show through whole-transcriptome analysis that Hha decreases biofilm formation in both LB and LB glu media by (i) repressing fliC encoding the main structural flagellar protein flagellin, (ii) by repressing fimA encoding the major structural subunit of type I fimbriae, (iii) by repressing ihfA encoding a subunit of the transcriptional regulator IHF that induces the transcription of type I fimbriae genes, (iv) by regulating tnaA encoding tryptophanase that inhibits biofilms, and (v) by repressing ybaJ that forms an operon with hha. more...

Given that oxidatively damaged proteins are generally degraded rather than repaired, we anticipated that Lon deficient cells would exhibit decreased viability during aerobic, but not anaerobic, carbon starvation.  We found that the opposite actually occurs.  Wild-type and Lon deficient cells survived equally well under aerobic conditions, but Lon deficient cells died more rapidly than the wild-type under anaerobiosis. more...

1547. Global transcriptional response of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to growth transitions in glucose minimal medium
(Submitter supplied) Background: Global patterns of gene expression of Escherichia coli K-12 during growth transitions have been deeply investigated, however, comparable studies of E. coli O157:H7 have not been explored, particularly with respect to factors regulating virulence genes and genomic islands specific to this pathogen. To examine the impact of growth phase on the dynamics of the transcriptome, O157:H7 Sakai strain was cultured in MOPS minimal media (0.1% glucose), RNA harvested at 10 time points from early exponential to full stationary phase, and relative gene expression was measured by co-hybridization on high-density DNA microarrays. more...

1548. Common genome-wide patterns of transcript accumulation underlying the wing polyphenism and polymorphism in the pea aphid
(Submitter supplied) The pea aphid, Acyrthosiphon pisum, exhibits several environmentally cued polyphenisms, in which discrete, alternative phenotypes are produced. At low density parthenogenetic females produce unwinged female progeny, but at high density females produce progeny that develop with wings. These alternative phenotypes represent a solution to the competing demands of dispersal and reproduction. Males also develop as either winged or unwinged, but these alternatives are determined by a genetic polymorphism. more...

(Submitter supplied) The effect of a cueO mutation on global gene expression in E. coli has been analysed using whole genome oligonucleotide microarrays. A cueO mutant lacks a periplasmic multi-copper oxidase, an enzyme that is believed to be involved in the oxidation of cuprous and ferrous ions as well as phenolic compounds in the periplasm. Deletion renders the cell sensitive to copper and this toxicity is likely associated with increased oxidative stress in a cueO mutant. more...

1584. E. coli Transcriptome Dynamics during the Transition from Anaerobic to Aerobic Conditions
(Submitter supplied) Escherichia coli is a metabolically versatile bacterium that is able to grow in the presence and absence of oxygen.  Several previous transcript-profiling experiments have compared separate anaerobic and aerobic cultures.  Here, for the first time, the process of adaptation was investigated by determining changes in transcript profiles when anaerobic steady-state cultures were perturbed by the introduction of air. more...

1590. Transcriptional consequences of DNA gyrase inhibition 
(Submitter supplied) DNA gyrase is an essential enzyme whose activity is required for DNA replication and chromosome maintenance. Inhibition of gyrase results in multiple physiological effects including changes in DNA superhelicity, replication arrest and DNA damage. Using genetic, genomic, statistical and biochemical techniques, we have untangled the contribution of individual effects, assessed their relative significance and concluded that: i) DNA replication is required for the formation of spatial transcriptional domains; ii) transcriptional response to gyrase inhibition is coordinated between at least two modules involved in DNA maintenance, relaxation and damage response; iii) genes whose transcriptional response to gyrase inhibition does not depend on the activity of topoisomerase I can be classified on the basis of the GC excess in their upstream and coding sequences into, respectively, activated and repressed by gyrase inhibition; iv) relaxation by topoisomerase I dominates the transcriptional response upon gyrase inhibition, followed by the effects of replication and RecA. more...

1628. Time course analysis of genes regulated by E. coli sigma E (rpoE) after overexpression
(Submitter supplied) DNA microarray analysis of genes regulated by the alternative sigma factor, sigma E (rpoE). Sigma E-dependent genes were initially identified by comparing a wild type (wt) E. coli K-12 strain that has a low level of sigma E, with a strain over-expressing sigma E (following induction of rpoE from an inducible promoter by IPTG). We monitored changes in gene expression in 4 separate time-courses after induction and used SAM (Statistical Analysis of Microarrays) to identify 75 significantly induced and 8 significantly repressed genes. more...

1629. BW25113 glucose to acetate transition 
(Submitter supplied) In bacterial adaptation to the dynamic environment, metabolic genes are typically thought to be the executors, whereas global transcription regulators are regarded as the decision makers. Although the feedback from metabolic consequence is believed to be important, much less is understood. This work demonstrates that the gluconeogenic genes in Escherichia coli, ppsA, sfcA, and maeB, provide a feedback loop to the global regulator, CRP, in carbon source transition. more...

(Submitter supplied) Bacterial adaptation to nutrient limitation and increased population densities is central to survival and virulence. Surprisingly, <3% of Escherichia coli genes are known to play roles specific to the stationary phase. There is evidence that the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) may play an important role in stationary phase, so this study used microarrays representing >98% of E. coli genes to more comprehensively identify those controlled by Lrp. more...

(Submitter supplied) RyhB is a non-coding RNA regulated by the Fur repressor.  It has previously been shown to cause the rapid degradation of a number of mRNAs that encode proteins that utilize iron.  Here we examine the effect of ectopic RyhB production on global gene expression by microarray analysis.  Many of the previously identified targets were found, as well as other mRNAs encoding iron-binding proteins, bringing the total number of regulated operons to at least 18, encoding 56 genes. more...

1634. RNase G complementation of rne null mutation identifies functional interrelationships with RNase E
(Submitter supplied) The Escherichia coli endoribonucleases RNase E (Rne) and RNase G (Rng) have sequence similarity and broadly similar sequence specificity. Whereas the absence of Rne normally is lethal, we show here that E. coli bacteria that lack the rne gene can be made viable by overexpression of Rng. Rng-complemented cells accumulated precursors of 5S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the RNA component of RNase P (i.e. M1 RNA), indicating that normal processing of these Rne-cleaved RNAs was not restored by RNase G; additionally, neither 5S rRNA nor M1 RNA was generated from precursors by RNase G cleavage in vitro. more...

E. coli deficient in dam are hypersensitive to cisplatin.  However introducing an additional mutation in mismatch repair (i.e., a mutation in mutS or mutL) abrogates this sensitivity and essentially restores wildtype levels of resistance. more...
