# EGOAL: gene Expression Prediction based on Abductive Learning and Gene Ontology

This is a project of 2024 AI+ Contest, School of Artificial Intelligence,
Nanjing University.

This project is also part of Drylab of iGEM team Nanjing-China 2024.

In this project, we predict gene expression with abductive learning.
The prediction only works on Shewanella Oneidensis currently.
